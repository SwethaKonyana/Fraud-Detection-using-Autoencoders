OVERVIEW:
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using deep learning techniques, particularly Autoencoders. The model is trained to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent claims based on historical data.
FEATURES:
Preprocessing and feature engineering for insurance claim data.
Implementation of deep learning models (Autoencoders) for fraud detection.
Evaluation of model performance with precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization of results for better interpretability.
TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
Framework: Deep Learning (Autoencoders)
INSTALLATION AND SETUP:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/SwethaKonyana/Insurance-Fraud-Detection.git
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the training script:
python train_model.py
Evaluate the model:
python evaluate.py

Dataset

The dataset used for training consists of insurance claim records with labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature encoding, and normalization.
